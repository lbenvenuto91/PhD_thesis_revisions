	ABSTRACT = {Using mobile smart devices to provide urban location-based services (LBS) with sub-meter-level accuracy (around 0.5 m) is a major application field for future global navigation satellite system (GNSS) development. Real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning, which is a widely used GNSS-based positioning approach, can improve the accuracy from about 10–20 m (achieved by the standard positioning services) to about 3–5 cm based on the geodetic receivers. In using the smart devices to achieve positioning with sub-meter-level accuracy, a feasible solution of combining the low-cost GNSS module and the smart device is proposed in this work and a user-side GNSS RTK positioning software was developed from scratch based on the Android platform. Its real-time positioning performance was validated by BeiDou Navigation Satellite System/Global Positioning System (BDS/GPS) combined RTK positioning under the conditions of a static and kinematic (the velocity of the rover was 50–80 km/h) mode in a real urban environment with a SAMSUNG Galaxy A7 smartphone. The results show that the fixed-rates of ambiguity resolution (the proportion of epochs of ambiguities fixed) for BDS/GPS combined RTK in the static and kinematic tests were about 97% and 90%, respectively, and the average positioning accuracies (RMS) were better than 0.15 m (horizontal) and 0.25 m (vertical) for the static test, and 0.30 m (horizontal) and 0.45 m (vertical) for the kinematic test.},

	abstract = {Real-time differential (RTD) positioning can achieve a real-time metre-lever positioning based on the differential correction data from a nearby reference station. However, the time-delay of correction data is generally unavoidable when receiving it from the reference station in real-time. Multi-global navigation satellite system combined positioning has the advantages of improving the positioning availability, continuity and accuracy; however, it remains unknown whether it can effectively overcome the time-delay of differential correction in RTD positioning. This Letter focus on the tolerance of time-delay for differential correction in BeiDou global navigation satellite system (BDS) and global positioning system (GPS) combined RTD positioning. Based on a set of static data and a set of dynamic data, the performances of BDS standalone, GPS standalone and BDS and GPS combined RTD positioning by 15 kinds of time-delay of the differential correction data were studied and compared. The numerical results show that, BDS and GPS combined RTD positioning can tolerate longer time-delay of the corrections than BDS or GPS standalone positioning for the same requested positioning accuracy.},

	abstract={Photogrammetry is one of the most used techniques for monitoring and surveying. It is widely used in several applications and in different working conditions. Accuracy of photogrammetry reconstruction methods may change depending on the working conditions (e.g. the number of acquired images, lighting conditions, baselines between images), and it is strictly related to the success of the solution of the Structure from Motion problem. Despite its widely spread use and the ever growing improvements to the reconstruction technique, photogrammetry still does not reach the same level of reliability of laser scanning surveying techniques: significant issues may occur in photogrammetric reconstructions when in presence of lighting problems or when the object of interest is not sufficiently textured. However, it relies on the use of much cheaper tools with respect to laser scanning techniques and surveying is usually much faster. This paper aims at showing the potential improvement that can be obtained by introducing information provided by the navigation system in the 3D reconstruction algorithm: the goal is that of making the solution algorithm of the Structure from Motion problem more reliable and accurate. As a side effect, faster reconstruction is typically achieved. The technique is validated on a building using images and navigation information got from a standard smartphone.},

	ABSTRACT = {The recent access to GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) phase observations on smart devices, enabled by Google through its Android operating system, opens the possibility to apply precise positioning techniques using off-the-shelf, mass-market devices. The target of this work is to evaluate whether this is feasible, and which positioning accuracy can be achieved by relative positioning of the smart device with respect to a base station. Positioning of a Google/HTC Nexus 9 tablet was performed by means of batch least-squares adjustment of L1 phase double-differenced observations, using the open source goGPS software, over baselines ranging from approximately 10 m to 8 km, with respect to both physical (geodetic or low-cost) and virtual base stations. The same positioning procedure was applied also to a co-located u-blox low-cost receiver, to compare the performance between the receiver and antenna embedded in the Nexus 9 and a standard low-cost single-frequency receiver with external patch antenna. The results demonstrate that with a smart device providing raw GNSS phase observations, like the Nexus 9, it is possible to reach decimeter-level accuracy through rapid-static surveys, without phase ambiguity resolution. It is expected that sub-centimeter accuracy could be achieved, as demonstrated for the u-blox case, if integer phase ambiguities were correctly resolved.},

	ABSTRACT = {Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning is currently a common practice thanks to the development of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. The possibility to obtain raw GNSS measurements, such as pseudoranges and carrier-phase, from these instruments has opened new windows towards precise positioning using smart devices. This work aims to demonstrate the positioning performances in the case of a typical single-base Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning while considering two different kinds of multi-frequency and multi-constellation master stations: a typical geodetic receiver and a smartphone device. The results have shown impressive performances in terms of precision in both cases: with a geodetic receiver as the master station, the reachable precisions are several mm for all 3D components while if a smartphone is used as the master station, the best results can be obtained considering the GPS+Galileo constellations, with a precision of about 2 cm both for 2D and Up components in the case of L1+L5 frequencies, or 3 cm for 2D components and 2 cm for the Up, in the case of an L1 frequency. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that it is not feasible to reach the phase ambiguities fixing: despite this, the precisions are still good and also the obtained 3D accuracies of positioning solutions are less than 1 m. So, it is possible to affirm that these results are very promising in the direction of cooperative positioning using smartphone devices.},

ABSTRACT = {The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver is one of the many sensors embedded in smartphones. The early versions of the Android operating system could only access limited information from the GNSS, allowing the related Application Program Interface (API) to obtain only the location. With the development of the Android 7.0 (Nougat) operating system in May 2016, raw measurements from the internal GNSS sensor installed in the smartphone could be accessed. This work aims to show an initial analysis regarding the feasibility of Zenith Total Delay (ZTD) estimation by GNSS measurements extracted from smartphones, evaluating the accuracy of estimation to open a new window on troposphere local monitoring. Two different test sites have been considered, and two different types of software for data processing have been used. ZTDs have been estimated from both a dual-frequency and a multi-constellation receiver embedded in the smartphone, and from a GNSS Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS). The results have shown interesting performances in terms of ZTD estimation from the smartphone in respect of the estimations obtained with a geodetic receiver.},

abstract = {Summary Since the barometer measures the weight of the overlying atmosphere, it follows by the law of Gladstone and Dale that the height integral ∫(n − 1)dr of the atmospheric refractivity for radio microwaves, taken from ground level up to the top of the stratosphere, is in a dry atmosphere directly proportional to ground pressure. The refractivity integral, therefore, can be determined without detailed knowledge of the height distribution of the refractive index, which not only simplifies the derivation of refraction formulas in which atmospheric models have been used hitherto, but also improves their accuracy. The range correction for troposphere and stratosphere to be subtracted from the observed microwave distance will be given by the formula Δs(meters) = 0.002277 sec z[p + (1255/T + 0.05)e − 1.16 tan2 z] where z is the zenith distance, p is the total barometric pressure and e is the partial pressure of water vapor, both in millibars, and T is the absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin.}

ABSTRACT = {In an urban scenario, GNSS performance is strongly influenced by gross errors in the measurements, usually related to multipath and non-line-of-sight phenomena. The use of RAIM algorithms is a common approach to solve this issue. A significant amount of the existing GNSS receivers is currently mounted on smart devices, above all, smartphones. A typical drawback of these devices is the unavailability of raw measurements, which does not allow fully exploiting the GNSS potential; in particular, this feature limits the use of RAIM algorithms. Since 2016, for few smart devices, it has been finally possible to access GNSS raw measurements, allowing the implementation of specific algorithms and enabling new services. The Xiaomi Mi 8 is equipped with the Broadcom BCM47755 receiver, able to provide dual-frequency raw measurements from quad-constellation GPS, Glonass, Galileo, BeiDou. In this work, the performance in an urban area of the Xiaomi Mi8 GNSS was analyzed. An important issue of smartphone GNSS is related to the antenna, which is not able to protect from the multipath phenomenon; this issue has a large probability to emerge in hostile environments like urban areas. As a term of comparison, the high-sensitivity receiver NVS NV08C-CSM, connected to a patch antenna, was used. In particular, the considered receivers were placed in the same location, and their positions were estimated in single point positioning, applying a classical RAIM algorithm. An error analysis was carried out, and the obtained results demonstrated the effectiveness of RAIM when applied to Xiaomi Mi8 GNSS measurements.},

abstract = {Abstract Integer ambiguity fixing is routinely applied to double-differenced GPS phase measurements to achieve precise positioning. Double-differencing is interesting because it removes most of the common errors between the different signal paths. However, if common errors can be estimated it becomes attractive to fix integer ambiguities on undifferenced measurements. Phase measurements then become pseudorange-like measurements with a noise level of a few millimeters. This paper introduces a new method for fixing dual-frequency GPS ambiguities on undifferenced phase measurements either locally or globally. The clocks for the GPS constellation obtained during this process can be used for precise point positioning of ground based receivers and for precise orbit determination of low Earth orbiting satellites. The resulting positioning precision is comparable to that of standard differential positioning without the need for a reference station. Ambiguity-fixed satellite orbits for the GRACE and Jason satellites are more precise than the most precise solution available today.},

title = {Towards sub-meter positioning using android raw GNSS measurements},
abstract = {This paper presents a first analysis on the positioning performance using raw GNSS dual-frequency measurements acquired by the Xiaomi Mi 8 smartphone. In our study, we used the code-only-based Single Point Positioning technique for epoch-by-epoch positioning, and the Precise Point Positioning technique, which is based on both code and carrier-phase measurements, on precise satellite orbit and clock corrections, as well as on a dynamic model to exploit the time-constant property of the phase ambiguities. The functional model used in both our own SPP and PPP algorithms is based on the uncombined GNSS observation equations. As the Xiaomi Mi 8 smartphone is able to track both GPS and Galileo systems in two frequencies, we will present results based on single and combined GNSS solutions in single- and dual-frequency mode. The performance of these solutions will be assessed in terms of their repeatability and accuracy with respect to the ground-truth, while the improvement in Android-based positioning with multiple frequencies and GNSSs will be assessed compared to the GPS L1-only SPP case. An optimal combination of the elevation cut-off angle and the carrier-to-noise density ratio mask will be explored in order to have a reasonable balance between availability and quality of observations. Both real-time and post-processing positioning results will be presented.},
